# IaC Developer Tools CLI for CDK (IDT)

This command line interface tool automates many of the tedious tasks of building, adding to, documenting, and extending AWS CDK applications. It is an opinionated tool that integrates Well-Architected principals of cloud native software design by default.

## What is does

1. Automates templated build of a basic multi-stack CDK application with integrated security, devops, and pre-formatted documentation.
2. Automates templated build of a starter CDK stack
3. Automates templated build of a starter CDK construct
4. Automates templated build of DevOps tooling for CDK deployment on Github or Gitlab

## How to use it
